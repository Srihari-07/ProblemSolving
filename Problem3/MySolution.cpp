// Given the value of  d for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t])?
/*
1. Unnecessary Use of Extra Vectors:
You are using appleDistances and orangeDistances, but you donâ€™t really need them.
You can calculate the landing position and check the condition directly inside the loop, saving memory and making the code faster.

2. Redundant Variables:
houseStartingPoint and houseEndingPoint just store s and t, which are already available.
appleTreeLocation and orangeTreeLocation are also unnecessary since they just store a and b.

3. Code Optimization for Better Performance:
Instead of two separate operations (push_back and then checking the range), you can combine them in a single step inside the loop.
